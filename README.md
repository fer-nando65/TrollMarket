<h3>📌 Project Description</h3>

TrollMarket is a mini e-commerce project developed using the Spring Boot framework. This project simulates an e-commerce system with various essential features required for online transactions.

<h3>🛠 Technologies Used</h3>

* Backend: Spring Boot

* Frontend: Website connected to the backend via REST API

* Database: SQL Server

* Security: JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication and authorization

<h3>✨ Key Features</h3>

🔐 User Authentication & Authorization

* ✅ User login and registration feature
* ✅ Authentication and authorization implemented using JWT Token
* ✅ Role-based access control to differentiate user permissions

🛒 Service, Product and Order Management

* ✅ CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for products
* ✅ Order management and transaction details
* ✅ Checkout process and shopping cart management

<h3> 🏗 Application Structure</h3>

🔹 Currently, the application still uses a monolithic architecture, where all features and services run within a single backend application.

<h3> 📦 Database & Data Storage</h3>

* ✅ Data stored using SQL Server
* ✅ Table relationships used to manage user, product, and transaction data

🌟 Project Advantages

* 🚀 Modular Structure: The backend is developed with a service-oriented approach to facilitate future management and feature development.
* 🔒 Secure System: The use of JWT Token ensures that only authenticated users can access specific features according to their roles.
* 🔗 Flexible Integration: REST API allows seamless communication between the frontend website and backend.
